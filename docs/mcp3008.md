# MCP3008 8-channel ADC

I've ported and adapted Tony di Cola's CircuitPython code from Adafruit's GitHub repo.

This is a proof of concept, but hey, it works.

At present, it only supports single-ended mode on the 3008, and it assumes
1. SPI on Pins GP2, 3 and 4
1. ~CS on Pin GP23

at a speed of 100000 baud.

I'll modify the code to make them configurable Real Soon Now(tm).

It should be obvious how to change these if you need to. If not, ping me:
romilly dot cocking at gmail dot com. 

Let me know if you need differential mode. I have no plans to support the 3002/3004 at present.

Sample code:

```python
from time import sleep
from mcp3008 import MCP3008

chip = MCP3008() 
while True:
    print(chip.read(0))
    sleep(1)
```
